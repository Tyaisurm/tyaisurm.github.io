            'Custom CSV Export' G Suite (Google Forms) add-on was created to be used as an
            alternative tool to the default CSV export functionality already
            provided in Google Forms. This add-on is provided 'as is' due to its nature as a little personal project
            , and it may stop working in the future, 
            if changes to Google Forms, or APIs are made. The developer, me, reserves right to update add-on later if need for it arises, 
            while respecting the Privacy Policy in potential future public releases. If any problems arise due to improper formatting or loss 
            of exported data during export to CSV files, please use the default exporting functinality provided on 
            Google Forms and/or send feedback to the developer. 
            The developer, me, does not take any responsibility of any problems that may occur 
            outside of the functionality provided by the 'Custom CSV Export' add-on. By using this add-on you agree to these
            terms.
            
          </p>
          <p>
            The use of this add-on is completely up to you. If you find this tool useful, then that's
            great! If you'd like to provide feedback, do so through the Marketplace page.
